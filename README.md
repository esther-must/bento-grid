## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned the importance of:
- Combining CSS Grid and Flexbox to create flexible layouts.
- Using media queries to ensure responsiveness across different devices.
- Managing pseudo-elements like `::after` to enhance design while keeping it adaptable for mobile screens.

Example code snippet demonstrating the use of CSS Grid for layout:

```css
.grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: auto;
    grid-template-areas:"item1 item2 item2 item6"
                        "item1 item4 item5 item6"
                        "item3 item8 item7 item7";
    gap: 27px;
    padding: 80px 160px;
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
    position: relative;
}

### Continued development

In the future, I aim to:

- Improve accessibility by incorporating ARIA landmarks and better keyboard navigation.
- Explore more advanced CSS techniques like animations and transitions to enhance the UI/UX.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) - Helped refine my responsive design approach.
